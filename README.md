#The Goal behing Simple Money IO

The **Simple Money \(SM\)** method is intended **to free** you from one of the biggest **worries** in the world: **money**.

By providing you with a set of powerful concepts on _how to manage your money in a quick and simple way_, the SM-Method could possibly free you of the burden of worrying if you make it through this month.

And if we say _quick and simple_ we really mean it. We aim for sitting down _only once a month for 1/2 hour_. The SM-Method relies only on a few simple concepts and is quick to learn as it provides three flavors _\(rare, medium & well done\) _ in an extension-like structure, that makes it easy for beginners to learn and provides powerful functionality for higher demands.
